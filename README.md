  - Send a message and receive a contextual response
  - Request body:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "I'm feeling anxious today",
      "user_id": "user123"
    }
    ```
  - Response:
    ```json
    {
      "response": "It's okay to feel anxious. Remember to take deep breaths and be kind to yourself.\nWould you like to talk more about what's making you feel this way?",
      "response_html": "It's okay to feel anxious. Remember to take deep breaths and be kind to yourself.<br>Would you like to talk more about what's making you feel this way?",
      "user_id": "user123",
      "message_id": 42,
      "context_analysis": {
        "user_id": "user123",
        "total_messages": 15,
        "engagement_level": "medium",
        "sentiment_trend": "negative",
        "common_topics": ["anxiety", "stress", "work"],
        "current_message_analysis": {
          "is_crisis": false,
          "urgency_level": "low",
          "is_negative": true,
          "message_length": 25,
          "has_question": false
        }
      }
    }
    ```

#### Response Formatting
- `response`: The raw text, with `\n` for newlines (for plain text or chat apps)
- `response_html`: The same text, but with `\n` replaced by `<br>` for easy HTML/web display

**Frontend best practices:**
- For web: Render `response_html` as HTML (e.g., `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React, or `v-html` in Vue)
- For mobile: Split `response` on `\n` and display as separate lines or paragraphs
- For chat apps: Use `response` as-is, most chat UIs handle `\n` as newlines

### Conversation History
- **GET** `/conversation/{user_id}/history?limit=20`
  - Retrieve conversation history for a specific user

### User Analysis
- **GET** `/user/{user_id}/analysis`
  - Get comprehensive analysis of user's conversation patterns and sentiment

### User Summary
- **GET** `/user/{user_id}/summary`
  - Get a summary of all user's conversations and patterns

### Health Check
- **GET** `/health`
  - Check API health status

## üßë‚Äçüíª Displaying AI Responses in Your Frontend

- **Web (HTML/React/Vue):**
  - Use the `response_html` field and render as HTML for proper line breaks.
  - Example (React):
    ```jsx
    <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: response_html }} />
    ```
  - Example (Vue):
    ```html
    <div v-html="response_html"></div>
    ```
- **Mobile (React Native/Flutter):**
  - Split the `response` string on `\n` and render each line as a separate `<Text>` or widget.
- **Chat Apps:**
  - Use the `response` field; most chat UIs will display `\n` as newlines.
